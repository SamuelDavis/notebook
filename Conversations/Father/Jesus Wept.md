**John 11:21-37**
> <sup>21</sup>"Lord," Martha said to Jesus, "if you had been here, my brother would not have died. <sup>22</sup>But I know that even now God will give you whatever you ask."
>
> <sup>23</sup>Jesus said to her, <span class="jesus">"Your brother will rise again."</span>
>
> <sup>24</sup>Martha answered, "I know he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day."
>
> <sup>25</sup>Jesus said to her, <span class="jesus">"I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me will life, even though they die; <sup>26</sup>and whoever lives by believing in me will never die. Do you believe this?</span>
>
> <sup>27</sup>"Yes, lord," she replied, "I believe that you are the Messiah, the Son of God, who is to come into the world."
>
> <sup>28</sup>After she had said this, she went back and called her sister Mary aside. "The Teacher is here," she said, "and is asking for you." <sup>29</sup>When Mary heard this, she got up quickly and went to him. <sup>30</sup>Now Jesus had not yet entered the village, but was still at the place where Martha had met him. <sup>31</sup>When the Jews who had been with Mary in the house, comforting her, noticed how quickly she got up and went out, they followed her, supposing she was going to the tomb to mourn there.
>
> <sup>32</sup>When Mary reached the place where Jesus was and saw him, she fell at his feet and said, "Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died."
>
> <sup>33</sup>When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who had come along with her also weeping, he was deeply moved in spirit and troubled. <sup>34</sup><span class="jesus">"Where have you lain him?"</span> he asked.
>
> "come and see, Lord," they replied.
>
> <sup>35</sup>Jesus wept.
>
> <sup>36</sup>Then the Jews said, "See how he loved him!"
>
> <sup>37</sup>But some of them said, "Could not he who opened the eyes of the blind man have kept this man from dying?"

# My Father's Perspective

> Christ has been killing it as the bridge between man and God trying to teach these people, and yet both Martha and Mary - some of his closest disciples - don't understand him as well as the Roman centurion.
> 
> Martha and Mary believe that if only Christ had been there, Lazerous might have lived.
> 
> The centurion understands that Christ can save people from anywhere at any time. We can infer that Christ probably would have preferred Mary say "Christ, I trust my brother's death is a part of your plan, and I am glad your plans are coming to fruition, but I am very sad because I miss him."
