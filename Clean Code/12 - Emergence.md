# Getting Clean via Emergent Design

simple design...
1. runs all tests
2. contains no duplication
3. expresses intent of the programmer
4. minimizes number of classes and methods

# Simple Design Rule 1: Runs All the Tests

The more testable a system is, the better; SRP facilitates this.

# Simple Design Rules 2-4: Refactoring

With tests, you can safely refactor

# No Duplication

DRYing even small sections of code can reveal violations of SRP

# Expressive

- good names
- small classes/functions
- standardized nomenclature
- unit testing

# Minimal Classes and Methods

avoid pointless dogmatism
