# The Three Laws of TDD

1. You may not write production code until you've written a failing unit test.
2. You may not write more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail, and not compiling is failing.
3. You may not write more production code than is sufficient to pass the currently failing test.

 # Keeping Tests Clean

Clean tests should not break when production code changes, unless those changes are broken.

# Tests Enable the -ilities
